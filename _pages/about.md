Hi! My name is Yuchen Wu (吴雨宸 in Chinese). I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) of the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Prof. Aylin Caliskan](https://faculty.washington.edu/aylin/). My research interests are in LLM agent, personalization, and alignment. 

Before coming to UW, I have worked with [Prof. Kenji Yanai](https://mm.cs.uec.ac.jp/) at UEC, [Prof. Yong Li](https://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/#faculty) at THU, [Prof. Bhiksha Raj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IWcGY98AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Yuejie Chi](https://yuejiechi.github.io/) and [Prof. Laixi Shi](https://laixishi.github.io/) at CMU.

Here's my [CV](/assets/pdf/YuchenWu_Resume.pdf) and my email address is "yuchenw [@] uw [dot] edu".
