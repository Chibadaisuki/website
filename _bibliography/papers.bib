abstract = {Synthesized human trajectories are crucial for a large number of applications. Existing solutions are mainly based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), which is limited due to the lack of modeling the human decision-making process. In this article, we propose a novel imitation learning-based method to synthesize human trajectories. This model utilizes a novel semantics-based interaction mechanism between the decision-making strategy and visitations to diverse geographical locations to model them in the semantic domain in a uniform manner. To augment the modeling ability to the real-world human decision-making policy, we propose a feature extraction model to extract the internal latent factors of variation of different individuals and then propose a novel self-attention-based policy net to capture the long-term correlation of mobility and decision-making patterns. Then, to better reward usersâ€™ mobility behavior, we propose a novel multi-scale reward net combined with mutual information to model the instant reward, long-term reward, and individual characteristics in a cohesive manner. Extensive experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that our proposed model can synthesize the most high-quality trajectory data compared with six state-of-the-art baselines in terms of a number of key usability metrics and can well support practical applications based on trajectory data, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, our proposed method can learn explainable knowledge automatically from data, including explainable statistical features of trajectories and statistical relation between decision-making policy and features.},

abstractNote={Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.},

abstract="Images generated from Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) become blurry especially in areas with complex edges because of loss of edge information in downsampling of encoders. To solve this problem, we design a new model called ED-CycleGAN based on original CycleGAN. The key idea is using a pre-trained encoder: training an Encoder-Decoder Block (ED-Block) at first in order to get a difference map, which we call an edge map and is produced by the subtraction of input and output of the block. Then, the encoder part of a generator in CycleGAN share the parameters with the trained encoder of ED-Block and they will be frozen during training. Finally, by adding the output from a generator to the edge map, higher quality images can be produced. This structure performs excellently on ``Apple2Orange'', ``Summer2Winter'' and ``blond-hair2brown-hair'' datasets. We use SSIM and PSNR to evaluate resolution of results and our method achieved the highest evaluation scores among CycleGAN, Unit and DiscoGAN.",
